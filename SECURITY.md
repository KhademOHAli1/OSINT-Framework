## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in OSINT Framework, please follow these steps:

### üîí Private Disclosure

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them privately by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security-email@example.com] (replace with actual security contact)
2. **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### üìù What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability**: XSS, CSRF, injection, etc.
- **Location**: Which part of the application is affected
- **Step-by-step reproduction**: How to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for mitigation

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity

### üèÜ Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help keep our community safe. With your permission, we'll acknowledge your contribution in our security hall of fame.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **HTTPS Only**: Access OSINT Framework over HTTPS
3. **Browser Security**: Keep your browser updated
4. **Private Data**: Never input sensitive personal information

### For Contributors

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
2. **XSS Prevention**: Escape output, use Vue's built-in protections
3. **Dependencies**: Keep npm packages updated
4. **HTTPS Links**: Only link to HTTPS OSINT tools when possible
5. **No Secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or secrets

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Content Security Policy**: Configured to prevent XSS attacks
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All external links validated
- **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are properly escaped
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular automated dependency updates
- **Static Code Analysis**: Code quality and security checks

### Browser Security

The application leverages browser security features:
- **Same-Origin Policy**: For API requests
- **CORS**: Properly configured for external resources
- **Subresource Integrity**: For external CDN resources

## Vulnerability Categories

### High Priority
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data exfiltration
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

### Medium Priority
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Privilege escalation

### Low Priority
- Rate limiting issues
- Information leakage in error messages

## Security Considerations for OSINT Tools

Since this framework links to external OSINT tools:

1. **External Links**: We cannot guarantee the security of external sites
2. **User Responsibility**: Users should exercise caution when using linked tools
3. **Data Privacy**: Be aware of data collection by external services
4. **Malicious Sites**: Report any suspected malicious tools immediately

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Take affected systems offline if necessary
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and impact
3. **Communication**: Notify affected users through appropriate channels
4. **Remediation**: Deploy fixes and security updates
5. **Post-Incident**: Document lessons learned and improve processes

## Security Tools and Resources

### Recommended Security Tools
- **OWASP ZAP**: For web application security testing
- **npm audit**: For dependency vulnerability scanning
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: For static code analysis
- **Snyk**: For continuous security monitoring

### Security Resources
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
- [MDN Web Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security)

## Updates and Patches

Security updates will be:
- **Released immediately** for critical vulnerabilities
- **Communicated clearly** through GitHub releases and notifications
- **Backward compatible** when possible
- **Thoroughly tested** before deployment
